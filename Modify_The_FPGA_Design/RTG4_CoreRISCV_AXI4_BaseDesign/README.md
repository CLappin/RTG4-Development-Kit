# RTG4 CoreRISCV_AXI4 Base Design

### Overview
This Libero SoC design implements a simple RISC-V microcontroller design for a Microsemi RTG4 Rad-Tolerant FPGA. It includes a UART, GPIOs and timers. The RISC-V code executes from one of the DDR memory controller. This design is intended as a software development platform.

### IP packages
This design includes a number of IP packages that are not available by default from the Libero catalog. These packages are availalble from the [riscv-junk-drawer](https://github.com/RISCV-on-Microsemi-FPGA/riscv-junk-drawer/tree/master/IP-packages).
